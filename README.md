## Welcome to the Repo for Ghostwriter JS

[Check it out on AWS Amplify!](https://master.d1b31r1235u833.amplifyapp.com/)

Ghostwriter is a tool that will take two user inputs :

* Text
* Duration

---

Based on those inputs the text will be displayed letter after letter ,for the wanted duration, inside the Preview Window.

If you are happy with the Preview you will already find generated JavaScript & HTML that you can copy with a click and use that wherever you want !

---

Hope you have fun with Ghostwriter and feel free to use the contact form on the page to give me feedback and/or get in touch with me !
